            CrowdSound is a web application that allows for users to create a "party"
            </br> These parties can then be joined by others to allow for the party invitees
            to control what music they want to be played at the party by voting!

            The image below shows how party-goers can get involved in choosing the music for their party. <br>
            Whether it's by requesting songs to be played, or voting on the currently queued list of songs,
            the audience is in total control of the music that they hear!

            Currently CrowdSound is being slowly deployed on college campuses across the Northeast part of the United States. At this early stage on certain people have
            access to the software and ability to create a party. Once testing becomes open to the public, the goal is to expand across the United States and then internationally.

        <p class="center_text">
            At this point CrowdSound hopes to be an entirely free application for all users to experience. However, once the application begins to require more resources
            than can easily be allocated (aka it costs more money than my current college bank account can handle) ad's or a subscription based system may be implemented.
            Buuuut as of now it is entirely free to use!

            CrowdSound is currently a solo project at this time, but the possibility of opening up to open source, or adding developers to the team is an option that
            has been considered in the past. If you would like to get information on the development or offer your services, <br>
